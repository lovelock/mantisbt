# Goal of this project

I love mantis until I read the source code.

Yes, it has a long history. So, it needs to be refactored with modern PHP technology.

I just began this project, and I think below technologies will be used:

1. PHP7.
2. PDO.
3. Template Engine(Twig).
4. One of modern front-end technologies.
5. Composer
